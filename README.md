#Word Wars

This is a Scrabble-like game we made as a final project at Code Fellows JavaScript Developer Accelerator. It is fully functional, with dictionary lookup, scoring, and local multiplayer.

In the future we plan work on:
* Implementing network multiplayer
* Improving the look
* Getting the game to work on mobile
* Original bonus squares

For the time being we don't plan on fixing:
* The tray drop-through bug
* IE compatibility

Feel free to use our code if it helps you learn something.
