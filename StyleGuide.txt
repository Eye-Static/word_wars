Style Guide

---JavaScript---
//use single quotes and 'use strict';
'use strict';

//npm packages are listed first, then third party packages, then our packages
var $     = require('jquery');
var Board = require('./js/Board');

//function names should be camelCase
//name the params if they are required,
//use an options object for optional arguments
//curly braces should be aligned
//indent is 2 spaces
var functionName = function(param1, param2)
{
  var wellNamedVariable = [];  //use literal notation instead of 'new' when possible
  var board = new Board();     //constructors are capitalized, objects you instantiate are not
  this.param1 = param1;
  this.param2 = param2;   //use this style to set parameters
}

---File Structure---
//files that set what an object has/does are constructors and should start with UpperCase
//make code as modular as reasonably possible
//the logic that kicks off the application should be in app.js

---HTML---
//use the proper element (<sidebar> instead of <div class="sidebar">) when possible

//classes are for broader classes of things, ids are for individual things
//HTML classes, ids, etc are hyphenated, this helps distinguish them from JavaScript variables
<div class="example-item" id="item-1"></div>
<div class="example-item" id="item-2"></div>
<div class="example-item" id="item-3"></div>

//contruct the elements for best clarity
